 Resource staffing requirements is one full-time professional Human
 Resource person should be hired for every 100 employees. The actual ratio for a business can vary depending upon factors such as the degree of HR centralization, the geographic distribution of the employees served, the sophistication level of the employees, and the relative complexity of the organization.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr"><div><div style="display:block;text-align:left;margin-right:auto"><br /></div></div></div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align:center"><font size="6">What is the importance of Human resource?</font></div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">
 Behind production of every product or service there is an human mind, 
effort and man hours (working hours). No product or service can be 
produced without help of human being. Human being is fundamental 
resource for making or construction of anything. Every organisation 
desire is to have skilled and competent people to make their 
organisation competent and best. <br /></div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Among
 the five Ms of management, i.e., men, money, machines, materials, and 
methods, HRM deals about the first M, which is men. It is believed that 
in the five Ms, "men" is  not so easy to manage. "every man is different
 from other" and they are totally different from the other Ms in the 
sense that men possess the power to manipulate the other Ms. Whereas, 
the other Ms are either lifeless or abstract and as such, do not have 
the power to think and decide what is good for them. <br /><br /><div><div><div><br /><div style="text-align:center"><font size="6"><font color="#cc0000">Why do we call it as Human Resource Management?</font></font></div><div><b><font color="#0b5394"><br /></font></b></div><div><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><i><font size="4"><b><font color="#0b5394">Human:</font></b> refers to the skilled workforce in an organization.</font></i></span></div><div><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><i><font size="4"><b><font color="#0b5394">Resource: </font></b>refers to limited availability or scarce.</font></i></span></div><div><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><i><font size="4"><b><font color="#0b5394">Management:</font></b>
 refers  how to optimize  and make best use of such limited or scarce 
resource so as to meet the organization goals and objectives.</font></i></span></div><div><br /></div><div>Therefore,
 human resource management is meant for proper utilisation of  available
 skilled workforce and also to make efficient use of existing human 
resource in the organisation. The best example in present situation is, 
construction industry has been facing serious shortage of skilled 
workforce. It is  expected to triple in the next decade from the present
 30 per cent, will negatively impact the overall productivity of the 
sector, warn industry experts. <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Today many experts claim that machines and technology are replacing 
human resource and minimizing their role or effort. However,
machines and technology are built by the humans only and they need to be 
operated or at least monitored by humans and this is the reason
why companies are always in hunt  for talented, skilled and qualified
 professionals for continuous development of the organization.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Therefore

 defines- Human Resource Management as “planning, organizing, directing, controlling of 
procurement, development, compensation, integration , maintenance and 
separation of human resources to the end that individual, organizational
 and social objectives are achieved.” <br /><br /><font face="georgia, serif"><b>The National Institute of Personal Management</b></font>
 (NIPM) of India has defined human resources – personal management as 
“that part of management which is concerned with people at work and with
 their relationship within an enterprise. Its aim is to bring together 
and develop into an effective organization of the men and women who make
 up enterprise and having regard for the well – being of the individuals
 and of working groups, to enable them to make their best contribution 
to its success”. <br /><br />According to <font face="georgia, serif"><b>Decenzo and Robbins</b></font>,
 “Human
 Resource Management is concerned with the people dimension” in management. Since every
 organization is made up of people, acquiring their services, developing
 their skills, motivating them to higher levels of performance and 
ensuring that they continue to maintain their commitment to the 
organization is essential to achieve organsational objectives. This is 
true, regardless of the type of organization – government, business, 
education, health or social action”.<br /> <br /><br /><div style="text-align:center"><b><font size="6">Evolution of </font><font size="6">Human resource management</font></b></div><font color="#073763"><div style="display:inline;margin:5px 10px;float:right"><a href="http://www.whatishumanresource.com/human-resource-management/human%20relations%202.jpg?attredirects=0"><img border="0" src="http://www.whatishumanresource.com/_/rsrc/1513056428068/human-resource-management/human%20relations%202.jpg" /></a></div></font></div><div style="display:block;text-align:left;margin-right:auto"><font color="#073763"><br /></font></div><div style="display:block;text-align:left;margin-right:auto">Human resource management is evolved form the Personnel management which was

work, 8 hours rest and 8 hours sleep. Owen identified the importance of 
better working conditions at workplace and its impact on the 
productivity and efficiency of the workers. Owen after implementation of
 better working conditions at workplace, he observed change in the 
productivity of 
his workers as their efficiency increased. He in those  olden days 
implemented many 
social and welfare practices for his workers and saw his workers got 
happy, motivated and worked better. Therefore he was referred as father

 purpose of
 the Human resource management is to make the job and deal with the job 
holder (employee). So as
 to perform a job in an organisation, one needs to be identified. In 
order to identify 
right person for a particular job, notification should be issued which 
contains job description ( duties and responsibilities) and 
specifications ( academic qualifications and physical qualifications). 
So as to verify the correctness of the candidates invited, they should 
be tested by the suitable selection methods for picking-up right person.
 Subsequently selected 
candidates should be provided with the proper training for performing 
his duties &amp; responsibilities mentioned in the notification. Later, 
assessment of 
employees' performance should be done to know whether employees are 
performing to
 the desired standards set by the management. Accordingly employees 
should be rewarded or paid
 for the job they did in the organisation and their safety in the job is
 the responsibility of Hr manager or safety officer who should instruct 
safety measures for the employees and see that they are scrupulously 
followed. Healthy and welfare measures are so-so important to keep 
employees happy and motivated which has direct impact on their 
productivity. Doing so all, maintaining proper and healthy rela</span><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)">tionships
 between employees and management  avoids 
conflicts which will effect the overall performance of the organisation.
 Most important thing is adherence and not to ignore employment and 
labour laws which govern all the above said activities 
for a job. Contravenes  of employment laws will cost to the organisation
 and its branding. Hence the Human resource management is like a guardian 
angel for the organisation to sail smoothly and long-live.</span></div></font><font color="#073763"><div><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><br />The ten "Cs" of human resources management are: cost effectiveness, competitive, coherence, credibility, communication, creativity, competitive advantage, competence, change, and commitment.

 to the crux of difference, Personnel management is the seed and root for
 Human resources management. To say in simple words Human resource 
management is evolved from the Personnel management. <b>Main principle of the Personnel management was to extract work from an employee for the remuneration paid.</b>
 Employees during the 
Personnel management era were not given high priority in decision making
 process and weren't much allowed to interact with management. Personnel
 management was more confined to the factories and the main 
focus of the Personal manager was to see that everything was in 
compliance with the labour laws or not but not much emphasis made on the
 
morale of employees. Employees were just treated as tools, obligation to
 
the organisation but not as the asset of the organisation, besides they 
were seen as  cost &amp; expenditure to company rather than capital and
 investment. Personnel officers mostly used be disciplinary oriented 
instead of flexible and interactive with employees. Nurturing  of 
employees was not priority by the personnel managers and employees 
perspective was ignored which means personnel managers rather than 
understanding situation they used to be punitive if any error was 
committed by employee. <br /><br />Human resource management see employees 
from the perspective as a most valuable resources for the organisation 
and they consider their employees as assets and capital for their 
organisation. <a href="http://www.whatishumanresource.com/employee-motivation-introduction"><u><b>Motivating employees</b></u></a> is a basic feature of human resource management in contrast with personal management. <b>Main principle of the Human resource management is 
to see what should be given to an employee for extracting the desired 
work.</b> Hr Managers always encourage participation of employees in
 decision making and their suggestions are most valued. Flexibility in 
work, welfare and Work life balance to employees is high priority for Hr
 managers and they show much more concern towards employee issues. 
Adoption of new policies and optimisation methods by the Hr manager are 
well encouraged and swift. The finest difference between Personnel 
management and Human resource management is integration and augmentation
 of Information Technologies in the human resources management process 
and functions for enhanced productivity and time savings as time is 
money. All above Artificial intelligence and Roberts are taking over many Hr 
functions ranging from employees recruitment, Testing, interviewing and 
many more. <br /></span></div><div><div style="display:block;text-align:left;margin-right:auto"><div><div><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><br /></span></div></div></div></div><div><br /></div></div></font></div></div><div><div style="display:block;text-align:center;margin-right:auto"><b><font size="6">Who is responsible for human resource management?</font></b><br /></div><div style="display:block;text-align:left;margin-right:auto"><br /></div><div style="display:block;text-align:left;margin-right:auto">Human resource officer or Manager is responsible for human resource management in the organization.</div><div style="display:block;text-align:left;margin-right:auto"><br /></div><div style="display:block;text-align:left;margin-right:auto"><font color="#ff0000" face="georgia, serif">The HR Director</font> is a top-level manager responsible for the administration of all human resource activities and policies.
